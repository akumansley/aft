If you're on a Mac, install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then 

```bash
brew install awans/tap/aft
```

If you're on Windows or Linux, you can build from [source](https://github.com/awans/aft).

Run Aft locally, and then check out the [tutorial](tutorial/your-first-model):

```bash
aft -db ./my_db.dbl -authed=false
```
