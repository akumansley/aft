:::note
Aft is currently _pre-alpha_ software. It should be a useful tool for prototyping, but isn't quite ready for production workloads!

Aft is a tool for rapidly creating small API-driven backends.

Aft includes a powerful, intuitive API for reading and mutating data from a client. All you need to do is sketch out your schema. No separate database to run or migrateâ€”Aft will hold your data directly in memory, and write it down to a single file on disk.

Aft won't build a UI for you, but it will play nicely with whatever client technology you choose. 

It offers a UI for defining your a schema, custom datatypes with validation, access controls, a login system, scriptable RPCs, audit logging, and more.

Aft is free, MIT licensed, and was developed by [Andrew Wansley](https://twitter.com/awans) and [Chase Hensel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chasehensel/).
