You're now an Aft developer!

We looked at how to talk to Aft from a web app, how to use the login RPCs, how to define our own objects and work with them, and how to set access controls.

Aft has some advanced features like custom datatypes and interfaces that we didn't cover in this tutorial, and there's a lot more you can do to make building frontends easier using the powerful aft API. Check out the Overview documentation for more details.
