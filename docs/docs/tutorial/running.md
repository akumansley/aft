If you haven't installed Aft yet, read the [Getting started](../getting-started) page.

If you have Aft installed, run it:

```bash
aft -db tutorial.dbl -authed=false
```

You should see it print out:

```bash
Now serving on http://localhost:8080
```

Open that link in your browser.

You should see a page labeled `Schema`, and a listing of system models.
